#Java Sudoku Solver using Recursive Backtracking
This is a Java program that solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using recursive backtracking. The program reads the puzzle from a text file, solves it, and writes the solution to another text file. The program also prints the solution to the console.

#Usage
1. To use this program, follow these steps:

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ).

4. Create a text file with the unsolved Sudoku puzzle in the following format:

Copy code
0 0 3 0 2 0 6 0 0
9 0 0 3 0 5 0 0 1
0 0 1 8 0 6 4 0 0
0 0 8 1 0 2 9 0 0
7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8
0 0 6 7 0 8 2 0 0
0 0 2 6 0 9 5 0 0
8 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 9
0 0 5 0 1 0 3 0 0
Note: Use 0 to represent empty cells in the puzzle. Make sure to leave space between each number.

5. Update the filename variable in the Main.java file to match the name of the file you created in step 3.

6. Run the Main.java file with the text file as the argument.

7. The solved puzzle will be written to a file named solved_puzzle.txt, and it will also be printed to the console.

#How it Works
This program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. The algorithm works as follows:

Find an empty cell in the puzzle.
Try each number from 1 to 9 in the empty cell.
If the number is valid in the current cell (i.e., it doesn't violate any of the rules of Sudoku), move on to the next empty cell and repeat steps 2 and 3.
If none of the numbers from 1 to 9 are valid in the current cell, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number.
Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the entire puzzle is solved.
This algorithm is a type of brute-force search, but it is made more efficient by the use of backtracking. The algorithm only tries numbers that are likely to be correct, and it quickly discards numbers that lead to invalid solutions.
